### Hi! I'm Cassandra Marcussen. 
\[ she/her/hers \]

I am a PhD student in the Theory of Computation group at Harvard University. I am interested in theoretical computer science, probability theory, and combinatorics. In particular, I like to think about problems related to information theory, property testing, stochastic processes, randomized algorithms, and computational complexity.
