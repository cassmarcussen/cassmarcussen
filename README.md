### Hi! I'm Cassandra Marcussen. 
\[ she/her/hers \]

I am a senior at Columbia University studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I am interested in theoretical computer science, probability theory, and combinatorics. In particular, I like to think about problems related to stochastic processes, randomized algorithms, computational complexity, property testing, and information theory.
