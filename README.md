### Hi! I'm Cassandra Marcussen. 
\[ she/her/hers \]

I am a junior at Columbia University studying Mathematics and Computer Science. My interests lie in artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, and contributing to technology within these fields through efficient computing and low-level optimizations. 

I'm passionate about open source code, machine learning, and the moral and ethical queries surrounding the use of artificial intelligence. A fun fact about me is that I play the cello.
